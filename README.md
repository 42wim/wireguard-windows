### Building on Windows

```
C:\Projects> git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows
C:\Projects> cd wireguard-windows
C:\Projects\wireguard-windows> build
```

### Building on Linux

You must first have Go 1.12 and Mingw installed.

```
$ sudo apt install mingw-w64 golang-go
$ git clone https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-windows
$ cd wireguard-windows
$ make
```

### Running

After you've built the application, run `wireguard.exe` to install the manager service and show the UI.

```
C:\Projects\wireguard-windows> wireguard
```
